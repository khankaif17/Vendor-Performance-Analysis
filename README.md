Vendor Performance Analysis
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of vendor performance using historical procurement and delivery data. It aims to help organizations make data-driven decisions to identify high-performing vendors, flag underperformers, and improve supply chain efficiency.

📊 Project Overview

https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaifkhan123/vender-performance-analysis

The analysis includes:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performance metrics such as delivery timeliness, quality scores, and order accuracy
Visualizations for performance trends
Vendor classification based on performance

🧰 Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
Scikit-learn (optional: for clustering/classification)

📁 Files Included
vender-performance-analysis.ipynb — Main notebook containing data analysis, visualization, and insights.
README.md — Project overview and usage instructions.
(Optional) requirements.txt — List of Python packages used (see below to generate).

🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository (or download the notebook directly):
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vendor-performance-analysis.git
cd vendor-performance-analysis

2. Set up a Python environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook vender-performance-analysis.ipynb

✅ Sample Metrics Evaluated

On-Time Delivery Rate
Quality Rejection Rate
Cost Efficiency
Vendor Rating Trends

📈 Sample Visuals

Heatmaps and boxplots to visualize performance variability
Bar charts comparing vendors by performance metrics
Trend analysis over time

📌 Notes

Ensure your input dataset is formatted correctly (e.g., includes fields like Vendor ID, Delivery Date, Rating, etc.)
You can extend the notebook to include predictive modeling or clustering (e.g., K-Means for vendor segmentation)

📃 Requirements
You can generate a requirements.txt using:

pip freeze > requirements.txt
